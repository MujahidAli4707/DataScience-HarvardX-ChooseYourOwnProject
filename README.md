# DataScience-HarvardX-ChooseYourOwnProject

## Project Overview
This repository hosts the "DataScience-HarvardX-ChooseYourOwnProject," a comprehensive data science project undertaken as part of a HarvardX course. The project's goal is to accurately forecast traffic volume on an American interstate, using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (xgbTree) method implemented in R.

## Key Features
- **In-Depth Analysis**: Methodical hyperparameter tuning of the xgbTree model.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Detailed evaluation of model performance using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metrics.
- **Feature Importance**: Analysis of significant factors affecting traffic volume, with insights into time-of-day and day-of-week dependencies.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation of the methodology and findings in a PDF file.

## Repository Contents
- `Traffic_Forecasting.R`: Main R script with data analysis and model building.
- `Project_Documentation.pdf`: Comprehensive report on project methodology and findings.
- `CMD_Instructions.txt`: Command-line instructions for project execution.

## Installation
To replicate this analysis, ensure you have R installed on your system and clone this repository. Required R packages and installation instructions are detailed within the script.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open and run the `Traffic_Forecasting.R` script in an R environment.
3. Consult `Project_Documentation.pdf` for a detailed understanding of the project's methodology and results.
